# tumblr_archiver

The goal is to download all your liked content from Tumblr and do some sorting based in this content so that you have a good organized library of stuff you like.

The problem occured when the amount of likes came close to 10.000 and getting to this one thing I liked 5 months ago was not possible. Offline, and sorted, I think it is much easier to rediscover the things you like.
